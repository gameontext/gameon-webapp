## Building and testing the web front end 

The build requires node 6, and uses grunt and bower to manage builds.

```
npm install
bower install
grunt build
```

If you don't have these installed, don't worry! We have you covered! 

* From the webapp project itself, create a docker image for building:  
  ```
  docker build -f Dockerfile-node -t webapp-build .
  ```
  
  Then, to build, run: 
  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/app:/app webapp-build /usr/local/bin/local-build.sh
  ```
  To open a shell: 
  ```
  docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/app:/app webapp-build /bin/bash
  ```
  

* If you're building from the top-level `gameon` project with docker-compose, copy the following from `docker-compose.override.yml.example` into `docker-compose.override.yml`: 
  ```
  webapp-build:
    build:
       context: webapp
       dockerfile: Dockerfile-node
    command: /usr/local/bin/docker-build.sh
    volumes:
      - './webapp/app:/app'

  webapp:
    build:
      context: webapp
    volumes:
      - './webapp/app:/opt/www'
  ```

  After that, use `docker-compose` to manage building and rebuilding the web front-end: 
  ```
  docker-compose run webapp-build
  ```
  
  `go-run.sh` will rebuild the webapp project this way automatically, once the information is added to `docker-compose.override.yml`

## Running tests

By default, we use Karma with PhantomJS for unit testing: 

```
  grunt test
```
